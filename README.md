##INSTRUCTIONS:
#In your console, navigate to team_collab_api folder
#run "rails s -p 3001"
#Open a new console, and navigate to team_collab_client
#run "npm install"
#run "npm start"

##NOTES: I have already seeded the API with 60+ reports, as well as two users. If you'd like to start fresh, navigate to team_collab_api\db and delete "development.sqlite3" and schema.rb. Re-initialize the database by running "rake db:migrate" from the team_collab_api folder. You are then welcome to modify "seeeds.rb" with any data you would like to start with. If you wish to upload the seeded data, run "rake db:seed" from the console.

##ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: This project was created as the final portfolio project for Flatiron's Web Development program. It was a wonderful learning experience. My greatest hope is that it can help others as well. Please feel free to give it a download, take it apart, tinker with the code, and figure out what makes it tick. If you've got questions or want to reach out, shoot me an email at dande313 (at) gmail.com. I'd love to hear your insights.
